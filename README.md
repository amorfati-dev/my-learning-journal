# My Learning Journal

## Week 1  (26 May – 1 Jun 2025) ✅

### Highlights
- **Environment setup:** `cursor` IDE, Claude Sonnet, *SuperWhisper* — all installed, configured, and test-run.
- **CS50P:** Lessons 0–3 (Intro, Conditionals, Loops) completed; problem-sets solved and pushed.
- **Git fundamentals:** Finished basic course; practiced branch → PR → merge workflow on new GitHub repo.
- **Coding practice:** 2 Exercism challenges solved, reviewed, and merged via PR.
- **Utility scripts:** Wrote a few helper scripts that speed up repetitive tasks (e.g., repo scaffolding, run-all-tests).
- **Meta-note:** Identified “power days” (Mon/Tue/Thu) vs. “light days” (Wed/Fri) and protected weekends for rest.

| Metric | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| Hours invested | ~9 h |
| Challenges solved | 2 |
| Key takeaway | Early tooling setup removes friction later. |

| Day | Time spent | Focus & Outcome | Evidence |
| --- | ---------- | -------------- | -------- |
| **Mon 2 Jun** | 2 h | **CS50P #4 – Libraries**<br>– Watched lecture, took notes on `sys`, `random`, `csv`, `statistics`.<br>– Built `csv_stats.py` CLI that prints mean/median from a file.<br>– Added docstrings & `--help`. | commit `a1b2c3` |

### In Flight
- **Wed:** Git housekeeping — branch → merge → rebase cycle; update README.
- **Thu:** CS50P #5 – Unit Tests → write 3 pytest tests & wire up GitHub Actions CI.
- **Fri:** 30-min Linear-Algebra drill (vectors & matrices) on Khan Academy.

### Mood Check
> “Libraries module clicked quickly; first touch with Pandas feels powerful but needs more reps. Energy still high.”
