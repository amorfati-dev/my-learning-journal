- **CS50P:** Lessons 0–3 (Intro, Conditionals, Loops) completed; problem-sets solved and pushed.
- **Git fundamentals:** Finished basic course; practiced branch → PR → merge workflow on new GitHub repo.
- **Coding practice:** 2 Exercism challenges solved, reviewed, and merged via PR.
- **Utility scripts:** Wrote a few helper scripts that speed up repetitive tasks (e.g., repo scaffolding, run-all-tests).
- **Meta-note:** Identified “power days” (Mon/Tue/Thu) vs. “light days” (Wed/Fri) and protected weekends for rest.
